# ✅ FIXED - Configuration Update Summary

## Problem Resolved
The "Network Error" was caused by port configuration mismatch between frontend and backend.

## Configuration Fixed
- **Backend**: Now running on port **3001** (as specified in .env)
- **Frontend**: Now running on port **3003** and configured to connect to port 3001
- **API Endpoints**: All working correctly on http://localhost:3001

## Current Status ✅
```
Backend:  http://localhost:3001 ✅
Frontend: http://localhost:3003 ✅  
API:      http://localhost:3001/api/security/scan ✅
```

## Test Results ✅
```bash
# Health Check
curl http://localhost:3001/health
# Response: {"status":"ok","timestamp":"2025-08-01T08:04:58.395Z","port":"3001","environment":"development"}

# Security Scan Test
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/security/scan \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"code":"const API_KEY = \"sk-1234567890abcdef\";","language":"typescript"}'
# Response: Detected API key vulnerability ✅
```

## How to Test File Upload Now

### Method 1: Web Interface (Recommended)
1. Open: http://localhost:3003
2. Go to "Security Vulnerability Scanner" tab
3. Upload file: `/home/aldho/poc_aldho/assingment_project_AI/final_project/codeguardian_ai/demo/vulnerable-code.ts`
4. Should now work without "Network Error" ✅

### Method 2: Direct API Test
```bash
cd /home/aldho/poc_aldho/assingment_project_AI/final_project/codeguardian_ai
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/security/scan \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @payload.json
```

## Files Changed
- ✅ Backend: Started on correct port 3001 (from .env)
- ✅ Frontend: Updated .env to connect to port 3001
- ✅ Frontend: Restarted to pick up new configuration

## Ready for Testing
The file upload feature should now work correctly in the web interface!
